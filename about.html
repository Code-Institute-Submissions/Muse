			<p>Muse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. The
				band consists of Matt
				Bellamy, Chris Wolstenholme, and Dominic Howard.
				Muse signed to Maverick Records and released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing
				Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry
				(2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a
				reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence,
				with strings on tracks such as "Butterflies and Hurricanes", and was the first of five consecutive
				UK number-one albums.
				Black Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles
				such as "Supermassive Black Hole". The album brought Muse wider international success. The
				Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising
				and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was
				a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album,
				Simulation Theory (2018), prominently featured synthesisers and was influenced by science fiction
				and the simulation hypothesis.
				Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music
				Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012 they received the Ivor Novello Award for International
				Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. As of June 2016, they
				have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.</p>
